# 
# PDF compression and splitting tool dependency package
# 
# Note: This tool mainly relies on external command line tools and less on Python packages.
# 
# External tools that the core depends on (need to be installed in the system):
# - poppler-utils (includes pdftoppm, pdfinfo)
# - tesseract-ocr (OCR engine)
# - tesseract-ocr-eng (English language pack)
# - archive-pdf-tools (includes recode_pdf)
# - qpdf (PDF processing tool)
#
# Ubuntu/WSL installation command:
# sudo apt update
# sudo apt install poppler-utils tesseract-ocr tesseract-ocr-eng qpdf pipx
# pipx install archive-pdf-tools
# 
# Or run the installation script:
# chmod +x install_dependencies.sh && ./install_dependencies.sh
#
# Note: It is recommended to use pipx instead of pip3 to install archive-pdf-tools
# This can avoid polluting the system Python environment

# If you need to install archive-pdf-tools (recommended to use pipx)
# pipx install archive-pdf-tools>=1.4.1

# Alternative: If you donâ€™t have pipx, you can use the pip user to install it.
# pip3 install --user archive-pdf-tools>=1.4.1

# Optional: for testing and development
# pytest>=7.0.0
# pytest-cov>=4.0.0
